# Claude Instructions

## Process hygiene

Always stop any server or dev process you start before ending your response. This includes:

- `yarn dev` (Next.js)
- `yarn ladle` (Ladle component server)
- `npx tsx server/index.ts` (Express server)
- Any other long-running process started during the session

Use `pkill -f "<process pattern>"` or track the PID at start and kill it explicitly. Do not leave background processes running — the user will find stale `yarn dev` or `yarn ladle` instances after every session otherwise.
