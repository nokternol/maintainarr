"""Deterministic doc-to-code reference linker for plan-with-graph.

Problem this solves: graphify's own extraction never creates edges from a
markdown doc's prose to the code symbols/files it names, confirmed empirically
by live testing. Fixing that inside graphify (its LLM subagent pass, or its
build_merge dedup step) was tried and rejected: expensive, and the merge step
silently drops exactly these edges on node-fold collisions. This script never
touches graphify internals and never creates a new node — it only adds
`references` edges between nodes that already exist.

Deliberate, not implicit: this does NOT scan arbitrary backtick spans and
guess whether they're a label, a filename, or a full path (that was tried,
worked, but conflates "inline code for readability" with "this is a graph
reference" and leaves the target-identification mode implicit). Instead it
requires an explicit, unambiguous markup the doc author opts into:

    [display text](ref:label:ExactNodeLabel)
    [display text](ref:path:relative/path/from/repo/root.ts)

`ref:label:` resolves against a node's `label` field (must match exactly one
node). `ref:path:` resolves against a node's `source_file` field (must match
exactly one node - normally the whole-file node). Anything not written in
this form is not touched, on purpose.

Idempotent: every edge this script writes is tagged `"contributor":
"plan-with-graph-linker"`. Re-running it for the same doc first removes every
edge it previously wrote for that doc, then re-adds fresh ones from the
doc's current text - safe to run any number of times, from any trigger
(end of a plan-with-graph session, a git hook, a manual re-check), without
accumulating duplicates or depending on any other pipeline having run first.
